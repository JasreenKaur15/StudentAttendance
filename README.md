# Student Attendance Management System 📘

This project is a console-based **Student Attendance Management System** developed in **C++**. It was designed to simplify the daily task of recording and managing student attendance in a structured and efficient way.

## 🔧 Features

- Add new students with relevant details (name, roll number, class, etc.)
- Mark attendance for any date
- View attendance records
- Modify and delete student records
- View summary of attendance (total presents, absents, etc.)
- Simple, menu-driven interface

## 🛠️ Tools & Technology

- Language: C++
- IDE: Code::Blocks / Visual Studio Code (used for development and testing)
- File Handling: Used for storing and retrieving data persistently

## 🎯 Purpose

This project was developed as a mini project to understand and apply the concepts of:
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++
- File handling (read/write/update/delete)
- Data structures like arrays and structures

## 📁 How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the `.cpp` file.
2. Open it in a C++-compatible IDE (like Code::Blocks or Visual Studio Code).
3. Compile and run the program.
4. Follow the menu prompts to perform desired actions.

## 📝 Future Scope

- Add login system for admin and teachers
- Generate reports in .txt or .csv format
- GUI implementation using Qt or another C++ GUI framework

This project helped me understand real-world applications of C++ and how simple logic and file structures can be used to solve practical problems.
